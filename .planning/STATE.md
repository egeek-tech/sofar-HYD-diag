## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

-

- [Phase 01]: Extracted Modbus TCP/RTU codecs verbatim from main.go into internal/modbus package with slog logger injection

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 is highest-risk: Modbus transport extraction must preserve all protocol quirks from proven CLI tool
- Phase 5 needs research: atomic write-wait-read for pack selection, BMS fault bitmap decoding
